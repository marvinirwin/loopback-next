# Architectural challenges

## Build large scale Node.js applications with LoopBack 4

It's super easy to start developing in Node.js, but challenges will get in the
way as your project grows with more and more modules, components, developers,
teams, and releases. If you are building on an open framework or large-scale
application, you probably have increasing number of **hmm** moments in deciding
between **Be less opinionated** and **Don't repeat yourself**. This talk will
share our experience in building LoopBack 4 with TypeScript and illustrate
techniques, tools, and patterns proven to facilitate developing Node.js projects
at scale. What's even better is that LoopBack 4 builds an extensible and
composable foundation with set of design patterns into the framework to help you
create open APIs or applications that are positioned to scale in various
perspectives.

There are interesting challenges in building complex Node.js projects such as an
open framework or a large-scale application that involves many modules,
components and teams. As platform developers, we love to have the foundation to
perform common tasks and enforce best practices without repeating ourselves. On
the other hand, we also want to give control to developers if needed tp solve
the problem in their preferred ways or bring in additional capabilities
seamlessly without breaking the foundation. This tutorial will walk you through
scenarios and strategies to allow your Node.js project to scale up with many
types of artifacts bundled in multiple npm modules, developed by different
developers and teams. To name a few such use cases:

- How to customize the behavior of certain features, for example, use a
  different algorithm to hash passwords, allow a different logger function, or
  replace the built-in access control

- How to extend the capabilities of your framework/application, for example,
  allow a new authentication strategy, connect to a different database, or
  support another object storage provider

- How to decompose a flow/sequence of processing into actions, for example,
  perform authentication and authorization, impose rate limiting, route to
  corresponding controllers/methods, and invoke business logic to produce the
  response

- How to compose a set of actions into a meaningful flow/sequence, for example,
  set up a pipeline to process HTTP requests/responses, or allow delegation from
  controllers to repositories/connectors to interact with databases

This tutorial examines those typical scenarios where loose coupling is critical
for various parts to work together without knowing much about one another and
introduces common patterns to solve such problems with example code:

- Decoration and reflection: provide metadata management to capture knowledge of
  various artifacts
- Inversion of control and dependency injection: manage artifacts and their
  dependencies for resolution and composition - not the same old IoC and DI -
  it's built for async!
- Extension points and extensions: organize artifacts with loose coupling and
  promote extensibility
- Chain of responsibility: align a set of action into a meaningful sequence or
  flow
- Observation and notification: enable (async) event driven collaboration

## Overview

LoopBack 4 core is an open source TypeScript platform for Node.js, specializing
in building large scale applications with great flexibility, composability, and
extensibility.

## Key modules

- @loopback/metadata
- @loopback/context
- @loopback/core

These modules are used by the LoopBack framework to offer API and Microservice
capabilities. They can be used independently as a base platform to build large
scale applications in TypeScript and Node.js.

## Design goals

Some characteristics of large scale applications:

- Developed by many teams/developers
- Maintained for many years and releases
- Created as many modules
- Have many dependencies

Architectural disciplines are required to support such large scale applications.

- Modular/Decoupling
- Composable
- Extensible

Conflict of interest:

- Modular/Decoupling/Consistent vs. Fragmentation/Friction
- Composable vs. Extensible

## Scenario

https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/examples/greeter-extension

## Series

1. Universal registration and resolution for all artifacts

(Introduce the idea of `Context` and `Binding`)

- registry as the knowledge base
- consistent apis to retrieve or search artifacts
- supply values for registered entries

2. Dependency injection

(Beyond locating artifacts proactively in code, push dependencies to the target
inversely)

- By key: `@inject(key)`
- By filter: `@inject(filter)`
- Defer resolution: `@inject.getter`
- Listen on changes: `@inject.view`

- Create your own `injector`

3. Configuration

(An accompanying facility for bound artifacts to provide configurations)

- ctx.configure
- ctx.gtConfig
- `@config.*`

- Create your own configuration resolver

4. Make your module or application extensible

- extension point/extension pattern

5. Aspect-oriented programming

- observers and interceptors

## Deep dive

The magic `Context` - Inversion of Control (IoC) container and Dependency
Injection (DI) framework

- Context

  - A registry of bindings
  - A hierarchy of contexts
  - Add/remove entries
  - Find entries
    - By key
    - By tags
  - Observe entries
  - Resolve bound value(s)

- Binding

  - An entry in the registry
  - Key/tags/scope
  - How is a value fulfilled
    - Constant (to)
    - A factory function (toDynamicValue)
    - A class to instantiate (toClass)
    - A class to provide the value (toProvider)
    - An alias to another binding
  - Configure a binding
    - Fluent APIs
    - BindingTemplate functional programming

- Dependency injection

  - Sync vs. Async (ValueOrPromise)
  - Only applicable to classes and their members
  - Constructor dependency injection/property dependency injection/method
    parameter dependency injection
  - Decorators
    - `@inject.*`
    - Create your own decorator for injection
  - Create your own `resolve`
  - Detect circular dependencies

- Decorator

- Component

  - Contribution of bindings

- Interceptors
- Observers

* (Deep dive - the patterns) Extensibility
  - Extension point/extension
  - Discovering and ordering
  - Chain of handling
